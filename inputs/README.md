# INPUTS

# Emissions

The case studies simulate policies affecting emissions from various sources and sectors (e.g., power plants and onroad vehicles) and can provide a basis for evaluating the degree to which reduced complexity models appropriately represent the air quality impacts and health outcomes resulting from emissions changes for a range of policy-relevant scenarios. 

There are five separate policy scenarios of emissions reductions to various sources and sectors: electrical generating units (EGUs), onroad vehicles, cement kilns, refineries and pulp and paper.

# Meteorology/Other

InMAP requires a single netCDF format file containing 3D annual average meteorology, air quality, and deposition information. 

APEEP, EASIUR, and SA-BPT do not accept user-supplied meteorological input files although the formulation for these models was developed using meteorological parameters.
