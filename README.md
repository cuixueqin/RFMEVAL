A dataset is provided to help researchers perform systematic comparison of multiple reduced complexity models. The dataset includes consistent emissions and, where possible, meteorology for 5 different emissions control scenarios. Inputs were developed for 4 reduced complexity tools including the Intervention Model for Air Pollution (InMAP) (Tessum et al., 2017), Air Pollution Emission Experiments and Policy Analysis (APEEP) versions 2 and 3 (Muller and Mendelsohn, 2006), Estimating Air pollution Social Impact Using Regression (EASIUR) (Heo and Adams, 2015), and EPA's source apportionment benefit-per-ton tool (SA-BPT) (Fann et al., 2012). 

Input files, output files (air quality and monetized health impacts), and necessary application files (run control and code) are provided as part of this database to facilitate model comparison for current and future versions of these tools. Further, the input and output files for the Environmental Benefits and Mapping Community Edition (BenMAP-CE; https://www.epa.gov/benmap) system are also provided to allow for estimation of the monetized health impacts associated with each of these emission scenarios.
